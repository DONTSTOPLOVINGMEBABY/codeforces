# Codeforces

I competed in my first Codeforces competition on April 13th and really enjoyed it from the standpoint of developing my skills for writing and solving DSA questions on the fly. I think competing gives a solid idea as to where one stands in terms of interview readiness by providing a more rigorious enviornment than self-solving timed Leetcode problems. 

I still use Leetcode to discover and practice problems by category and track the bulk of my problem solving.
